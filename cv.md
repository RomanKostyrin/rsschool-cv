### From 2015 until 2018 I had some personal management experience.

### In 2018 I decided to try myself in front-end.

### In 2019 I finished some html/ccs course. After that I found a job and started developing some sites and applications for social networks.

### I am in love with Frontend! This is really excited for me to see right now what I did. In 2020 I had to move to Moscow and I worded like an IT specialist.

### Right now I am looking for a job like a Frontend Developer
